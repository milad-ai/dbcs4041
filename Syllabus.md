# **Course Objectives**
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to **database management systems (DBMS)** and their role in modern data-driven applications. It covers the **fundamentals of database theory**, **conceptual and logical design**, and **data access and manipulation** while emphasizing **best practices** for modeling, implementation, and optimization.

Students will gain proficiency in **relational database concepts** through **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling**, mapping ER diagrams to **relational schemas**, and formulating complex **SQL queries** for real-world analytical tasks.

The course also introduces key **data concepts and ethical considerations**:  

- Understanding the **data hierarchy (DIKW pyramid: Data → Information → Knowledge → Wisdom)**.  
- Introducing **bias and basic ethical issues** in working with data, along with emerging concepts such as **dataism**.  
- Learning the **four levels of data analytics**: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive.  

Beyond the fundamentals, the course introduces **modern trends and tools** in database management, such as:

- **Embedded and analytical databases** (e.g., DuckDB) for fast local processing.
- **Analytical vs transactional systems**: understanding **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)** vs **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**.
- **Data Warehouse** vs **Data Lake** vs **Lakehouse** architectures: understanding their differences, purposes, and how they integrate in modern data ecosystems.

- **Introduction to NoSQL databases** (e.g., MongoDB) and understanding when to choose them over relational systems.
- **Query optimization and indexing** for improved performance in large datasets. 
- **Big Data frameworks** (e.g., PySpark) for large-scale data analytics.  
- **Vector Databases** and their role in **AI-driven semantic search** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, including a **pgvector tutorial** demonstrating how to integrate vector search into PostgreSQL for similarity queries and AI use cases.
- **Integration with visualization tools** (Power BI) and **web applications** (Streamlit) for presenting insights interactively.
- **API development** for exposing database functionality and enabling programmatic access to data.

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

- Introduce fundamental concepts, terminology, and applications of databases.  
- Design ER models for simple applications and convert them into relational tables.
- Differentiate between **OLAP and OLTP systems** and understand their real-world use cases.
- Compare Data Warehouse, Data Lake, and Lakehouse approaches and determine when each is most effective.
- Formulate SQL queries effectively for data retrieval and manipulation.  
- Compare relational approaches with **NoSQL** paradigms and understand their trade-offs.
- Learn to connect databases with **Python** and perform **data analysis with Pandas and PySpark**.  
- Perform **data extraction, transformation, and visualization** to support business decisions.
- Build basic **APIs** to expose and integrate database functionalities into external applications.


The primary hands-on environment will be **PostgreSQL**, supplemented by **DuckDB, Marimo notebooks, and Power BI**, providing both industry-standard and cutting-edge perspectives on database management.

In the final project, students will design and implement a complete database system from conceptual modeling to relational implementation, accompanied by an interactive analytical dashboard and a simple web application for data exploration and reporting.

## **Homework Assignments**

You will have five sets of homework assignments, which together carry a total of 5 points. These assignments include both theoretical and practical exercises to help reinforce your learning throughout the course (See the [homework page](https://dbcs.ir/assignments/), which will be updated during the course). The due dates for these assignments will be posted on this website.

  - `HW<2-digits homework number>_<LastName>_<FirstName>`  
  - For instance, my first homework would be called: `HW01_Vazan_Milad`  
  - 📧 Send your homework to **hw@dbcs.ir**


⚠️ **Important:** Emails with this exact subject format will receive an automatic confirmation reply upon submission. If you do not receive this confirmation within **five minutes**, it means your email was not received.

> If the **deadline is extended**, students who have **not submitted** their assignment will receive another **automatic email** **one day before the new deadline**.



## **Exams**

The course will include **two exams**. Both exams will assess the required readings and topics covered in class. The first exam will be an "in-class" [midterm](https://dbcs.ir//exams), while the second will be a [final exam](https://dbcs.ir//exams) scheduled during the University's final examination period at the end of the semester.

**If you need to miss the midterm test due to illness or a family affliction, please contact me by email. A make-up exam for the midterm might be organized.**

## **Collaboration Policy**

You are encouraged to discuss the content of this course with anyone you like; however, it is essential to **maintain academic integrity** in your work. All homework assignments, projects, and exams must be completed independently, meaning you are not permitted to copy any part of another student’s solution, collaborate with others on your assignments, or use solutions from unauthorized sources, including the Internet. **Therefore, the solution you submit for each assignment must be solely your own, reflecting your understanding and effort.**

## **Generative AI Usage Guidelines**

## 1. Purpose of These Guidelines
Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude) can support your learning by explaining concepts, suggesting code examples, and offering design guidance. However, the **primary goal of this course** is for you to personally develop the skills, not rely solely on ready-made answers. These guidelines ensure deep learning, academic honesty, and ethical use.

## 2. Allowed Uses
You are encouraged to use generative AI tools for the following purposes:
- **Explaining Concepts**  
  Asking about differences, applications, or underlying theory (e.g., the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL).
- **Debugging Guidance**  
  Asking what a specific error means and exploring strategies to fix it.
- **Best Practices**  
  Example: “How should I manage database connections securely in Python?”
- **Exploring Libraries and Tools**  
  Example: “Which libraries are available for connecting Python to PostgreSQL?”
- **Improving Code Readability or Design**  
  Requesting feedback to simplify queries or optimize algorithms.
- **Comparing Approaches**  
  Example: “What are the advantages of SQL vs. NoSQL, or Pandas vs. PySpark?”
- **Learning Through Simple Examples**  
  Understanding patterns and structures without requesting final answers to assignments.

## 3. Prohibited Uses
Please **do not** use generative AI tools for the following:
- **Directly Solving Course Assignments or Projects**  
  Requesting final code or answers for graded work.
- **Bypassing the Learning Process**  
  Copying AI-generated solutions without understanding them.
- **Sharing Proprietary Course Content**  
  Posting full assignment or project descriptions into AI tools.
- **Using AI as the Only Source**  
  Ignoring course notes, lectures, and official documentation.

## 4. Transparency and Academic Integrity
- If you used generative AI in your work, **disclose it clearly** and explain how you used it (e.g., “I used ChatGPT to help explain a SQL error”).  
- Any misuse (e.g., submitting AI-generated answers as your own) violates academic honesty policies and may result in disciplinary action.

## 5. Examples

### 5.1 Acceptable Questions
- “How can I remove duplicate records in SQL?”
- “What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL?”
- “What visualization tools are available in Python that are similar to Power BI?”
- “Is there a more efficient way to normalize this database schema?”

### 5.2 Unacceptable Questions
- “Write the solution for Question 3 of Week 5’s assignment.”
- “Generate the complete code for the final project.”
- “Optimize this exact query from my homework and give me the final answer.”
- “Provide me with a ready-to-submit file for this task.”


## 6. Best Practices for Using Generative AI
- Treat AI responses as **guidance**, not final solutions.  
- Use AI to **enhance your understanding**, not replace your own problem-solving.  
- Ensure **progressive learning**: try solving on your own first, then use AI for clarification.
