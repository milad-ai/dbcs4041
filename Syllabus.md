# **Course Objectives**
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to **database management systems (DBMS)** and their role in modern data-driven applications. It covers the **fundamentals of database theory**, **conceptual and logical design**, and **data access and manipulation** while emphasizing **best practices** for modeling, implementation, and optimization.

Students will gain proficiency in **relational database concepts** through **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling**, mapping ER diagrams to **relational schemas**, applying **normalization techniques**, and formulating complex **SQL queries** for real-world analytical tasks.

Beyond the fundamentals, the course introduces **modern trends and tools** in database management, such as:

- **Embedded and analytical databases** (e.g., DuckDB) for fast local processing.  
- **Big Data frameworks** (e.g., PySpark) for large-scale data analytics.  
- **Vector Databases** and their role in **AI-driven semantic search** and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**.  
- **Integration with visualization tools** (Power BI) and **web applications** (Streamlit) for presenting insights interactively.

Throughout the course, students will:

- Build and deploy database applications starting from conceptual design to functional prototypes.  
- Learn to connect databases with **Python** and perform **data analysis with Pandas and PySpark**.  
- Compare relational approaches with **NoSQL** paradigms and understand their trade-offs.

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

- Introduce fundamental concepts, terminology, and applications of databases.  
- Design ER models for simple applications and convert them into relational tables.  
- Formulate SQL queries effectively for data retrieval and manipulation.  
- Utilize normalization techniques to enhance database design.  
- Distinguish between SQL and NoSQL database systems.
- Perform **data extraction, transformation, and visualization** to support business decisions.  

The primary hands-on environment will be **PostgreSQL**, supplemented by **DuckDB, Marimo notebooks, and Power BI**, providing both industry-standard and cutting-edge perspectives on database management.

In the final project, students will design and implement a complete database system from conceptual modeling to relational implementation, accompanied by an interactive analytical dashboard and a simple web application for data exploration and reporting.

## **Homework Assignments**

Throughout the course, students will complete several homework assignments aimed at reinforcing the concepts covered in lectures and reading materials (See the [homework page](https://dbcs.ir/assignments/), which will be updated during the course). The due dates for these assignments will be posted on this website.

Please follow the instructions to turn in your homework:
- Homeworks must be submitted electronically as PDF files.
- Files should be named according to the following scheme:
   - HW<2-digits homework number>\_\<LastName>\_\<FirstName>.pdf.
   - For instance, my first homework would be called HW01_Vazan_Milad.pdf.
- ðŸ“§ Email your homework to **hw@dbcs.ir**

## **Exams**

The course will include **two exams**. Both exams will assess the required readings and topics covered in class. The first exam will be an "in-class" [midterm](https://dbcs.ir//exams/midterm), while the second will be a [final exam](https://dbcs.ir//exams/final) scheduled during the University's final examination period at the end of the semester.

**If you need to miss the midterm test due to illness or a family affliction, please contact me by email. A make-up exam for the midterm might be organized.**

## **Attendance and Participation**

**Attendance is required**, and exceeding four absences may result in a penalty of up to 2 points off your total grade. Active participation in both in-class activities and the online message board is highly encouraged.

# **Grading**
- Class attendance and participation: **2** points 
- Homeworks: **5** points
- Final project: **5** points 
- Midterm exam (-----): **3** points
- Final exam (-----): **5** points 


## **Seeking Assistance**

Here are the available help resources, organized by the urgency of your issue:

### **Messaging**
Our course will utilize a Telegram group (link to be provided in class) as the primary communication platform for announcements and discussions. This is an ideal space for asking questions that can be answered by anyone. It's best to use this resource for non-urgent inquiries.

### **Talk with the Instructor**
For any issues at all, please reach out to the instructor:

- Speak with me before class  
- Raise your hand or speak up during class


## **Collaboration Policy**

You are encouraged to discuss the content of this course with anyone you like; however, it is essential to **maintain academic integrity** in your work. All homework assignments, projects, and exams must be completed independently, meaning you are not permitted to copy any part of another studentâ€™s solution, collaborate with others on your assignments, or use solutions from unauthorized sources, including the Internet. **Therefore, the solution you submit for each assignment must be solely your own, reflecting your understanding and effort.**

## **Generative AI Usage Guidelines**

You are encouraged to use Generative AI tools like ChatGPT for general coding-related queries. **However, refrain from asking these tools to directly solve problems from the course problem sets.** Below are examples of acceptable questions:
1. How can I remove duplicates in a SQL query?
2. How do I handle database connection errors in Python?
3. What are the differences between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL?
4. What libraries are available for connecting Python to PostgreSQL?

## **Required Tools and Accounts**

To successfully participate in this course, students are expected to prepare the following tools and accounts prior to the practical sessions:

- **Python**: [Install](https://www.python.org/downloads/) the latest stable version of Python for running scripts and interacting with databases.  
- **GitHub Account**: Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- **Streamlit Account and GitHub Integration**: Link your GitHub account to [Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/) to deploy database-driven web applications.
- **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)**
- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)**
- **DuckDB**: Install DuckDB for lightweight, embedded database tasks and analytical queries.
- **[Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)**: Used for data visualization and creating interactive dashboards to analyze database results. 
- **Marimo**: This will be used as the primary environment for interactive notebooks and coding sessions.
  > pip install "marimo[recommended]"
- **Pandas**:
  > pip install pandas
- **PySpark**:
  > pip install pyspark

 

### **Hardware Requirement**

For the SQL and practical sessions, students will need **a laptop or a smartphone** to follow along and complete in-class exercises.
