# **Course Objectives**
This course covers the fundamentals of database management, including conceptual and logical design, as well as access and manipulation of databases, and introduces students to best practices in modeling, design, and implementation using contemporary database management systems in organizations. Students will learn how to develop database applications, beginning with the design of an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, then mapping it to a relational model, and finally transforming this second model into an application. Throughout this course, students will not only acquire theoretical knowledge but also essential practical skills for working with database systems. In the practical section of the course, PostgreSQL will be utilized as a powerful and open-source database management system.


## **Learning Goals**

 Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

- Introduce fundamental concepts, terminology, and applications of databases.
- Design ER models for simple applications and convert them into relational tables.
- Formulate SQL queries effectively for data retrieval and manipulation.
- Utilize normalization techniques to enhance database design.
- Distinguish between SQL and NoSQL database systems.

## **Homework Assignments**

Throughout the course, students will complete several homework assignments aimed at reinforcing the concepts covered in lectures and reading materials (See the [homework page](https://dbcs.ir/assignments/), which will be updated during the course). The due dates for these assignments will be posted on this website.

Please follow the instructions to turn in your homework:
- Homeworks must be submitted electronically as PDF files.
- Files should be named according to the following scheme:
   - HW<2-digits homework number>\_\<LastName>\_\<FirstName>.pdf.
   - For instance, my first homework would be called HW01_Vazan_Milad.pdf.
- ðŸ“§ Email your homework to **hw@dbcs.ir**

## **Exams**

The course will include **two exams**. Both exams will assess the required readings and topics covered in class. The first exam will be an "in-class" [midterm](https://dbcs.ir//exams/midterm), while the second will be a [final exam](https://dbcs.ir//exams/final) scheduled during the University's final examination period at the end of the semester.

**If you need to miss the midterm test due to illness or a family affliction, please contact me by email. A make-up exam for the midterm might be organized.**

## **Attendance and Participation**

**Attendance is required**, and exceeding four absences may result in a penalty of up to 2 points off your total grade. Active participation in both in-class activities and the online message board is highly encouraged.

# **Grading**
- Class attendance and participation: **2** points 
- Homeworks: **5** points
- Final project: **5** points 
- Midterm exam (-----): **3** points
- Final exam (-----): **5** points 


## **Seeking Assistance**

Here are the available help resources, organized by the urgency of your issue:

### **Messaging**
Our course will utilize a Telegram group (link to be provided in class) as the primary communication platform for announcements and discussions. This is an ideal space for asking questions that can be answered by anyone. It's best to use this resource for non-urgent inquiries.

### **Talk with the Instructor**
For any issues at all, please reach out to the instructor:

- Speak with me before class  
- Raise your hand or speak up during class


## **Collaboration Policy**

You are encouraged to discuss the content of this course with anyone you like; however, it is essential to **maintain academic integrity** in your work. All homework assignments, projects, and exams must be completed independently, meaning you are not permitted to copy any part of another studentâ€™s solution, collaborate with others on your assignments, or use solutions from unauthorized sources, including the Internet. **Therefore, the solution you submit for each assignment must be solely your own, reflecting your understanding and effort.**

## **Generative AI Usage Guidelines**

You are encouraged to use Generative AI tools like ChatGPT for general coding-related queries. **However, refrain from asking these tools to directly solve problems from the course problem sets.** Below are examples of acceptable questions:
1. How can I remove duplicates in a SQL query?
2. How do I handle database connection errors in Python?
3. What are the differences between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN in SQL?
4. What libraries are available for connecting Python to PostgreSQL?
