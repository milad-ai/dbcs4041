## Final Project

- **Total Weight:** 5 points  

For the final project, each student must design and implement a complete database system from scratch and deploy it using Streamlit and PostgreSQL, leveraging **Ploomber Cloud** for deployment and **Neon** for serverless PostgreSQL database management.

### Steps and Grading

1. **Topic Selection & Requirements Analysis (1 point)**  
   - Choose a real-world topic (e.g., library system, student management, e-commerce).  
   - Analyze functional and non-functional requirements and document them clearly.

2. **ER Diagram Design (1 point)**  
   - Create a comprehensive Entity-Relationship diagram based on the requirements.

3. **ER-to-Table Conversion (1 point)**  
   - Map the ER diagram to relational tables with proper keys, attributes, and constraints.

4. **SQL Implementation (1 point)**  
   - Write SQL scripts to create tables and populate them with sample data in PostgreSQL.

5. **Streamlit Application (1 point)**  
   - Build a user interface with Streamlit to interact with the database (e.g., insert, update, query).
